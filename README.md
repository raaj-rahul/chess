# Chess Game in Python

This is a simple chess game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game allows two players to play chess on a graphical interface. Each piece moves according to standard chess rules.

## Features

- Playable chess game for two players
- Graphical interface using Pygame
- Pieces move according to chess rules
- Highlight the selected piece
- Basic board setup with images for each chess piece

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Install Pygame

To install Pygame, you can use pip. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the following piece images saved in an `images` folder within the project directory:
   - `white_pawn.png`
   - `black_pawn.png`
   - `white_rook.png`
   - `black_rook.png`
   - `white_knight.png`
   - `black_knight.png`

   - `white_king.png`
   - `black_king.png`

   You can find chess piece images online or create your own.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the project directory where `chess.py` is located.
5. Run the game using the following command:

```bash
python chess.py
```

## How to Play

- Click on a piece to select it.
- Click on a valid square to move the selected piece.
- The turn will switch automatically between players after a valid move.

## Future Improvements

- Add AI functionality to play against the computer.
- Implement check and checkmate conditions.
- Enhance the UI with better graphics and animations.
- Include special moves like castling and en passant.
